###Instructions:
Create a SnapEngage trial account, install the chat code on a webpage
Configure the POST API to send chat details to an endpoint you will create - http://developer.snapengage.com/post-api/post-api/
Your endpoint should persist chat data, allowing it to be accessed again
Using the data you store, visualize or analyze it in some way you feel is interesting

###Understood Directions

Using the provided JSON data, visualize the information in an interesting and/or useful way. A working system is preferable but we're also interested in seeing your design approach, what tools and frameworks you used, and how you present the data to the user. When you are finished please provide us with a link to the source code and a live demo page.


Sign up for a SnapEngage account and using our Open API integration send several chats to an external system that you develop. Then using the same external system, display the information that was collected during those chats using the solution you developed.

###Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries.
*Spring Boot  to make it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with minimum fuss.
*spring MVC to separate models-views-controllers.
*thymeleaf for server side HTML templating.
*postgresql for the server database, mainly set this up for using the API in the future.
*Heroku for the server / live demo.
*Github for code.
*Bootstrap for styling.
